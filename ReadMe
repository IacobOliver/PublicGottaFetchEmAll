   "useEffect(() => {
        let gatheringPokemons = [];

        for (let i = 1; i <20 (CHANGE THIS NUMBER) ; i++) {     HERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE NUMBERS OF POKEMONS ( MAX 1000, NOT RECOMENDED!!!), FOR A GOOD

                .then(res => res.json())
                .then(res => gatheringPokemons.push(res))
        }

        setTimeout(() => {
            setAllPokemons(gatheringPokemons);
            setLoadig(true)
